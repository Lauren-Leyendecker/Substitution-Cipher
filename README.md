# Substitution-Cipher-NEW
This program processes a text file encrypted with a substitution cipher and allows the user to try to break the encryption using frequency analysis. The program asks the user for the file name that contains the encrypted text and then prints the encrypted text within the file. The program then prints the frequency of each ASCII character from 32 to 126 within the text as well as the initial decryption key/substitution cipher and decrypted version of the text. The program then asks the user if they want to make any changes to the substiution cipher and if they do then it asks them for the plaintext source letter to update and for the the new letter that the source letter should decrypt to. The substitution cipher is then updated based on the user's choices and the new version of the decrypted text is printed out. This is repeated until the user no longer wants to make changes to the substitution cipher. Afterwards, the final versions of the decryption key/substitution cipher and the decrypted text are printed out.
